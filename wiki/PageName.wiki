= Synchronize your heroes with your PC using dropbox =

Starting with DsaTab Version 3.1 you can configure the path to your heroes xml files seperately. This way you can use your dropbox dir as a heroes container. 

But since the android dropbox is not yet very good at both way synconization I would suggest using the app DropSync (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) There a free version available which lets you sync one folder which is enough for DsaTab.

Install the app and configure *DropSync* to sync your heroes folder with a existing dropbox folder. This way your heroes should always be update no matter wether you are modify them in the app or using the Helden-Software Desktop application on your PC.
